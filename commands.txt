After cloning the repo, you should be able to run the docker-compose up command in the root folder (spotify_api_project)
and it should get the project up and running. you might need to run this twice if postgresql doesn't start up fully
    docker-compose up / down



Setting up the project for the first time. This assumes you dont have the project folder, or the manage.py yet.
If you run this after deleting data, spotify_api_project, and manage.py, the command will fail.

    docker-compose web django-admin startproject spotify_api_project .
